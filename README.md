# todo

This is my starter angular todo app with a sole intetion of trying to 
understand how an angular app should actually be structured with scalling in mind.

I am also using it to try to understand how 
akita actually works.

akita is simply a state management library and you can read about it at the link below

Anyone is allowed to use it in is own ways.
